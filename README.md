# Paddle_flask
Deploy the trained Paddleseg model as a web application by using Flask.

## Introduction

This is a simple demo for creating [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) applications to deploy the trained [Paddleseg](https://github.com/paddlePaddle/paddleseg) model.

A trained paddleseg model should be put in the `code` folder and paddleseg should be cloned to the `work` subfolder. All the other code files are self-explained if you are familiar with using of flask.

A detailed work flow description in Chinese can be found in [AI Studio](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/projectdetail/1731233).
